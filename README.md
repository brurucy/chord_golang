## How to run

I have compiled several binaries, just for you. Choose the one `chord_golang*` that matches your OS and at least one should work. If neither of the binaries works, check [How to compile](#how-to-compile)

```bash
chord_golang Input-file.txt
```

## How to compile

To compile the program yourself:

1. Install Golang 1.15.5 from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Run in the project directory :
```bash
go build 
```
